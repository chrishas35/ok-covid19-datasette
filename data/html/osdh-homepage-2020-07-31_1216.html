    <div id="output"><p>COVID-19 is a virus identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Asia in late 2019 that has since spread globally into a pandemic. Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. While roughly 80% of cases report mild symptoms, some progress into severe pneumonia and multi-organ failure and can lead to death. On January 21, 2020, the first set of individuals in the <a data-auth="NotApplicable" data-ogsc="" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2F2019-ncov%2Fcases-in-us.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">United States</a> tested positive for COVID-19. The virus has since spread across all 50 states and the number of individuals testing positive for COVID-19 continues to rapidly grow each day.</p><p><strong>We publish COVID-19 data daily, however the numbers reflect a situation that is constantly changing. As more information is known (e.g. home address/city/county of a person identified as a case, etc.), updates are made to the data on a daily basis.</strong></p><p><strong>As COVID-19 data move into our reporting system, it can take a few days to fully investigate and verify the information. We aim to provide accurate data based on what is known on a given day. This is why various totals (for example: city, zip code, and county case totals) may not always align.</strong></p></div>  </div>
